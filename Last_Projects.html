      <p>The process for making this app wasn’t that hard. To determine what changes to make in each version, we just ranted on everything wrong on the app. We also tried to make the app more interesting which is also how we determined the versions. For example, we increased the speed so that way the PirateShip moves faster. This makes the app more responsive and fun to play. To add on, some functions wouldn’t work like the screens. The screens would work for the ai companion app. If you do the screens for the apk file, the app doesn’t go that screen. If the apk file was able to go to the different screens, then we had a starting screen and an instruction screen. Overall, the process of making our app wasn’t that hard. All we had to do was make the app more interesting and fun to play to dictate the versions.

              <p><strong>Our Creative Process:</strong>It initially began as us trying to brainstorming random ideas and taking knowledge of other games and see how we could implement that to our own game. We came up with some good ideas, and the fact that both of us played games in our free time, helped us come up with ideas for our game. We found that by making the game more sophisticated throughout the  way was an easy way  to tackle the Version Control. After playing games like Fruit Ninja and knowledge of arcade games, we came up with our game. The knowledge we had on games was very helpful to the development of our game.
